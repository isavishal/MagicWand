# Scratch Game ( MagicWand )

In the grand auditorium of a magical school, the head teacher explains about How to get the magical wand?

The game begins.

Take control of the main character positioned at the bottom left corner and use the arrow keys to navigate through a maze-like scene. Avoid unpredictable alien movements as they patrol the area. Reach the top right corner to collect the magical wands, but be careful not to collide with the aliens, which would reset your position.

Successfully collecting the wands triggers a victory scene with the message "YOU WIN!"
